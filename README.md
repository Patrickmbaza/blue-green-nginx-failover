# Blue-Green Deployment with Nginx Auto-Failover

A production-ready blue-green deployment setup with automatic failover, zero-downtime deployments, and chaos testing capabilities using Docker Compose and Nginx.

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a robust blue-green deployment strategy with the following features:

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Two identical environments (Blue and Green) running simultaneously
- **Automatic Failover**: Nginx automatically routes traffic to the healthy environment
- **Zero Downtime**: Seamless switching between environments without service interruption
- **Chaos Testing**: Built-in endpoints to simulate failures and test resilience
- **Header Preservation**: Maintains application headers through the proxy layer

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Git

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd blue-green-nginx

2. Configure Environment
bash

# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your preferred values
nano .env

3. Deploy
bash

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps

4. Access the Application

    Main Application: http://localhost:8090

    Blue Service Direct: http://localhost:8081

    Green Service Direct: http://localhost:8082

üîß Configuration
Environment Variables (.env)
bash

BLUE_IMAGE=my-blue-app          # Blue environment image
GREEN_IMAGE=my-green-app        # Green environment image
RELEASE_ID_BLUE=blue-1.0.0      # Blue release identifier
RELEASE_ID_GREEN=green-2.0.0    # Green release identifier
ACTIVE_POOL=blue                # Initial active environment

Port Mapping
Service	Host Port	Container Port	Purpose
Nginx	8090	8080	Main application entry point
Blue App	8081	3000	Direct access to blue environment
Green App	8082	3000	Direct access to green environment
üéØ API Endpoints
Application Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/	GET	Application root (redirects to /version)
/version	GET	Returns version info with headers
/healthz	GET	Health check endpoint
Chaos Testing Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/chaos/start	POST	Start chaos mode (simulates failures)
/chaos/stop	POST	Stop chaos mode
Chaos Mode Parameters

    mode=error - Returns 500 errors

    mode=timeout - Simulates timeouts (not implemented)

üîÑ Deployment Workflow
Normal Operation

    Blue is the active environment receiving 100% of traffic

    Green is the backup environment, ready for failover

    Nginx monitors Blue's health with aggressive timeouts

Failover Scenario

    Blue service starts failing (500 errors or timeouts)

    Nginx detects failures within 1-3 seconds

    Automatic traffic routing to Green environment

    Zero failed client requests (internal retry mechanism)

Manual Deployment Process
bash

# 1. Deploy new version to Green environment
# 2. Test Green environment directly (port 8082)
# 3. Update nginx.conf to switch traffic to Green
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload

# 4. Blue becomes the new backup
# 5. Deploy next version to Blue when ready

üß™ Testing
Basic Health Check
bash

# Test main application
curl http://localhost:8090/version

# Test direct access
curl http://localhost:8081/version  # Blue
curl http://localhost:8082/version  # Green

Failover Testing
bash

# 1. Start with normal operation (all traffic to Blue)
curl http://localhost:8090/version

# 2. Induce chaos on Blue
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/chaos/start?mode=error"

# 3. Wait for failover (2-3 seconds)
sleep 3

# 4. Verify traffic is routed to Green
curl http://localhost:8090/version

# 5. Stop chaos
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/chaos/stop"

Headers Verification
bash

# Check preserved headers
curl -I http://localhost:8090/version

# Expected headers:
# X-App-Pool: blue|green
# X-Release-Id: blue-1.0.0|green-2.0.0
