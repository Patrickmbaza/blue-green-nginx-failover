Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions and design rationale for implementing a Blue/Green deployment pattern with automatic failover using Nginx as a reverse proxy. The solution prioritizes zero-downtime deployments, rapid failover, and minimal client impact during service failures.
Core Architecture Decisions
1. Primary-Backup Upstream Model

Decision: Use Nginx's backup directive for the Green upstream rather than round-robin load balancing.

Rationale:

    Clear traffic routing semantics: Blue always receives traffic unless unhealthy

    Simplified operational model: predictable behavior during failures

    Eliminates split-brain scenarios where both services receive traffic simultaneously

    Aligns with Blue/Green deployment patterns where only one environment is "live"

Implementation:
nginx

upstream app_backend {
    server app_blue:3000 max_fails=2 fail_timeout=5s;  # Primary
    server app_green:3000 backup;                      # Backup only
}

2. Environment-Driven Configuration

Decision: Use environment variables and template substitution for dynamic configuration.

Rationale:

    Enables CI/CD systems to control deployment behavior without code changes

    Supports parameterized testing across different environments

    Aligns with Twelve-Factor App principles for configuration

    Facilitates automated grading and testing as specified in requirements

Implementation:
yaml

environment:
  - ACTIVE_POOL=${ACTIVE_POOL:-blue}
  - BLUE_UPSTREAM=app_blue:${BLUE_PORT:-3000}
  - GREEN_UPSTREAM=app_green:${GREEN_PORT:-3000}

Nginx Configuration Rationale
3. Aggressive Failure Detection

Decision: Configure tight timeouts and low failure thresholds for rapid failover.

Settings Chosen:

    max_fails=2: Detect failure after 2 consecutive errors

    fail_timeout=5s: Remove from pool for 5 seconds on failure

    proxy_connect_timeout=2s: Fast connection failure detection

    proxy_read_timeout=5s: Prevent client request hanging

Rationale:

    Meets requirement of "zero failed client requests" through quick detection

    Balances between failure sensitivity and network flakiness tolerance

    5-second fail timeout allows for quick recovery while preventing rapid flip-flop

4. Comprehensive Retry Policy

Decision: Implement retry on multiple failure conditions within the same request.

Implementation:
nginx

proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
proxy_next_upstream_tries 2;
proxy_next_upstream_timeout 5s;

Rationale:

    error: Catches network-level failures (connection refused, DNS issues)

    timeout: Catches slow responses exceeding configured timeouts

    http_5xx: Catches application-level errors as required

    Limited to 2 retries to prevent excessive latency amplification

    5-second total retry timeout ensures requests complete within 10-second requirement

5. Header Preservation Strategy

Decision: Forward all application headers unchanged to clients.

Implementation:
nginx

proxy_pass_request_headers on;
# No proxy_hide_header for X-App-* headers

Rationale:

    Required by specification to preserve X-App-Pool and X-Release-Id

    Maintains application intent and observability

    Enables clients to determine which service handled their request

    Supports debugging and monitoring without proxy interference

Docker Compose Design
6. Health Check Configuration

Decision: Implement container-level health checks with conservative settings.

Settings:

    interval: 5s: Frequent enough for rapid detection

    timeout: 3s: Allows for slow startup but detects hung processes

    retries: 3: Prevents flapping on transient issues

    start_period: 10s: Allows application boot time

Rationale:

    Provides container orchestration-level health awareness

    Complements Nginx's application-level health checking

    Prevents Docker from routing to containers that are starting/crashing

7. Network Isolation

Decision: Use a dedicated bridge network for service communication.

Rationale:

    Isolates application traffic from host network

    Enables service discovery via Docker DNS

    Provides clean separation for potential multi-host expansion

    Enhances security by limiting exposure

Failure Handling Strategy
8. Failover Trigger Conditions

The system triggers failover when:

    Network failures: Connection refused, DNS resolution failures

    Timeout failures: Services exceeding 5-second response time

    Application errors: HTTP 5xx status codes from the service

    Health check failures: Repeated failures of /healthz endpoint

9. Client Experience Guarantees

Achieved:

    âœ… Zero failed client requests (retry mechanism)

    âœ… Maximum 10-second request timeout (5s primary + 5s retry)

    âœ… No observable downtime during failover

    âœ… Clear indication of which service handled request via headers

Trade-offs and Considerations
10. Performance vs. Safety Trade-offs
Decision	Performance Impact	Safety Benefit
Low max_fails	Faster failover	More sensitive to transient errors
Short timeouts	Better latency	More 504s under load
Retry mechanism	Potential latency	Zero failed requests
11. Operational Complexity

Simplifications Made:

    No SSL/TLS termination (focus on core failover logic)

    No access logging or metrics (minimal viable product)

    No rate limiting or advanced security features

    Single Nginx instance (no high-availability proxy layer)

Alternative Approaches Considered
12. Load Balancing Algorithms

Rejected: Round-robin or least-connections with health checks
Reason: Doesn't provide the clear primary/backup semantics required

Rejected: Active-active with weighted routing
Reason: Overly complex for the specified Blue/Green requirement
13. Service Discovery

Rejected: Dynamic service discovery (Consul, etcd)
Reason: Added complexity without significant benefit for two static services

Rejected: DNS-based failover
Reason: Too slow (TTL constraints) and doesn't support request-level retry
14. Health Check Implementation

Rejected: Custom health check scripts in Nginx
Reason: Built-in health_check directive provides sufficient functionality with less complexity

Rejected: TCP-level health checks only
Reason: HTTP-level checks provide better application state awareness
